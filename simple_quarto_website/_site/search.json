If one gets rid of these habits one can think more clearly, and to think clearly is a necessary first step toward political regeneration: so that the fight against bad English is not frivolous and is not the exclusive concern of professional writers.1\n\n\nThe trend is strikingly clear: at every activity level, generalist users are much more likely to remain on Spotify than specialist users. Furthermore, the effect is very large. For example, among the least active users, specialists churn at a rate 30 percentage points (p.p.) higher than the global average, whereas the same figure is only 5 p.p. above average for generalists at the same activity level. Among highly active users, the specialists’ churn rate is 3 p.p above average while generalists churn 7 p.p below average. Additionally, at the higher activity levels, changes in the GS-score are much more associated with changes in user retention than changes in activity are (the high-activity curves in Figure 5 start to overlap each other). This is especially remarkable given that user engagement (i.e. activity) is traditionally the strongest predictor of user retention. (Anderson et al. 2020)\n\n\nThere are varieties of online infrastructure that have been prepared by many educational firms and made free for learning during this pandemic. The affordability and accessibility to these online infrastructures for all the learners of varied economic backgrounds are still a challenge. Students with special needs having learning difficulties, such as hearing impairment, visual impairment and mobility disabilities, require additional training with support and guidance. Many caregivers and parents at home are not able to cater to such needs, hindering the learning of this group of learners. Therefore, there is a need for investing time and resources to explore and research the best alternatives for the special educational needs (SEN) of these learners. As all students’ assignments and examinations are carried out from home, it is challenging for educators to find the authenticity of the work and the actual learning taking place. Moreover, many parents guide and support their children during their learning process, and the extent and degree of support varies greatly. Grading of students is another area of study as no proper criteria are developed and effectively used. (Pokhrel and Chhetri 2021)\n\n\nReferences\n\nPokhrel and Chhetri (2021) Anderson et al.
